Fixes positioning of the selected widgets, when the page is scrolled down. 

== Description ==

Enable "Fixed widget" option in the widget settings and it will be always in sight when page is scrolled down or up. There is no problem to "fix" or "stick" more than one widget even located in different sidebars!

[Live demo!](http://q2w3.ru/fixed-widget-demo/)

New in version 5.0:
1. Optimized client side performance. Detection of page changes is now based on MutationObserver API. Widget parameters recount is fired only when needed! Refresh interval option used only for campatibility with old browsers (no MutationObserver API support).
2. Improved compatibility with caching plugins (W3TC, Autoptimize and etc.). No need to exclude jQuery and plugin files from cache!
3. Async/Defer script load method support
4. Added `Disable Width` and `Disable Height` options

Note for cache plugins users. Don't forget to clear the cache after upgrading to version 5! Options format has been changed!

Compatibility note. The plugin is not working with all themes! Theme requirements:

* jQuery 1.7 required. jQuery 1.8.3 (or later) is recommended.
* No JavaScript errors, coused by other plugins and scripts.
* `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions in header.php and footer.php files.

In some cases (widget "jumping" during scroll and etc.) theme CSS changes may be required.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why plugin is not working? =

There are several reasons:

1. Javascript errors on page. Commonly caused by buggy plugins. Check javascript console of your browser. If you find errors, try to locate and fix its source. 
2. No `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions in template. Check header.php and footer.php files of your active theme.
3. Conflicts with other plugins and scripts
4. CSS incompatibility

= Why the plugin is not working in Chrome (and other Webkit based browsers)? =

Check your CSS files for these two instructions:
`-webkit-backface-visibility:hidden;
-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);`
If found, disable them and see the result.

= How to prevent overlapping with the footer? =

Go to WP admin area, Appearance -> Fixed Widget Options. Here you can define top and bottom margins. Set bottom margin value >= footer height. Check the result.
If your footer height is changing from page to page it is better to use `Stop ID` option. Here you need to provide html tag id. The position of that html element will determine margin bottom value. For example let's take Twenty Sixteen default theme. Theme's footer container has an id="colophon". In the `Stop ID` option I need to enter just colophon, without any other symbols!

= How to disable the plugin on mobile devices? = 
There are two options: `Disable Width` and `Disable Height`. They works the same way. If browser window width/height is less then or equals specified value - the plugin is disabled.
